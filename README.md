# Machines manager - inventory management application

### **Project description**

This project is a part of my engineering project. It is a fully working website that helps to manage user machines. 
You can browse and try the application here -> [Live application](https://machines-manager.vercel.app/)

## **Main features** ðŸŽ†
* Add, delete, and update machines

* Easily monitor and maintain machines with a kanban dashboard
* Quick access to clients' emails
* Fully functional user authentication
* Search component to browse through machines
* Calendar to display rented/serviced machines
* Statistics displaying expenses and incomes within the chosen year and quarter. Data is displayed both in raw form and in the form of charts
